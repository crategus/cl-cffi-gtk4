 "@version{2025-04-11}
  @begin{short}
    The @class{gtk:signal-list-item-factory} object is a
    @class{gtk:list-item-factory} object that emits signals to manage list
    items.
  @end{short}

  Signals are emitted for every list item in the same order:
  @begin{enumerate}
    @item{The @code{\"setup\"} signal is emitted to set up permanent things on
      the list item. This usually means constructing the widgets used in the
      row and adding them to the list item.}
    @item{The @code{\"bind\"} signal is emitted to bind the item passed via the
      @slot[gtk:list-item]{item} property to the widgets that have been created
      in step 1 or to add item specific widgets. Signals are connected to listen
      to changes - both to changes in the item to update the widgets or to
      changes in the widgets to update the item. After this signal has been
      called, the list item may be shown in a list widget.}
    @item{The @code{\"unbind\"} signal is emitted to undo everything done in
      step 2. Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers. Once this signal
      has been called, the list item will no longer be used in a list widget.}
    @item{The @code{\"bind\"} and @code{\"unbind\"} signals may be emitted
      multiple times again to bind the list item for use with new items. By
      reusing list items, potentially costly setup can be avoided. However, it
      means code needs to make sure to properly clean up the list item in step
      3 so that no information from the previous use leaks into the next use.}
    @item{The @code{\"teardown\"} signal is emitted to allow undoing the effects
      of the @code{\"setup\"} signal. After this signal was emitted on a list
      item, the list item will be destroyed and not be used again.}
  @end{enumerate}
  Note that during the signal emissions, changing properties on the list items
  passed will not trigger notify signals as the list item’s notifications are
  frozen. See the @fun{g:object-freeze-notify} function for details.

  For tracking changes in other properties in the list item, the
  @code{\"::notify\"} signal is recommended. The signal can be connected in the
  @code{\"setup\"} signal and removed again during the @code{\"teardown\"}
  signal.
  @begin[Signal Details]{dictionary}
    @subheading{The \"bind\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
lambda (factory item)    :run-first
      @end{pre}
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[factory]{The @class{gtk:signal-list-item-factory} object.}
        @entry[item]{The @class{gtk:list-item} object to bind.}
      @end{table}
      The signal is emitted when a new item has been set on the list item and
      should be bound for use. After this signal was emitted, the list item
      might be shown in a @class{gtk:list-view} widget or other list widget.
      The @code{\"unbind\"} signal is the opposite of this signal and can be
      used to undo everything done in this signal. @break{}
    @subheading{The \"setup\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
lambda (factory item)    :run-first
      @end{pre}
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[factory]{The @class{gtk:signal-list-item-factory} object.}
        @entry[item]{The @class{gtk:list-item} object to set up.}
      @end{table}
      The signal is emitted when a new list item has been created and needs to
      be setup for use. It is the first signal emitted for every list item.
      The @code{\"teardown\"} signal is the opposite of this signal and can be
      used to undo everything done in this signal. @break{}
    @subheading{The \"teardown\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
lambda (factory item)    :run-first
      @end{pre}
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[factory]{The @class{gtk:signal-list-item-factory} object.}
        @entry[item]{The @class{gtk:list-item} object to teardown.}
      @end{table}
      The @code{\"teardown\"} signal is emitted when a list item is about to be
      destroyed. It is the last signal ever emitted for this list item.
      This signal is the opposite of the @code{\"setup\"} signal and should be
      used to undo everything done in that signal. @break{}
    @subheading{The \"unbind\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
lambda (factory item)    :run-first
      @end{pre}
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[factory]{The @class{gtk:signal-list-item-factory} object.}
        @entry[item]{The @class{gtk:list-item} object to unbind.}
      @end{table}
      The signal is emitted when a list item has been removed from use in a list
      widget and its new item is about to be unset. This signal is the opposite
      of the @code{\"bind\"} signal and should be used to undo everything done
      in that signal.

  You need to connect signal handlers to the @code{\"setup\"} and
  @code{\"bind\"} signals before you use it. See the @class{gtk:list-view}
  documentation for a complete example.
